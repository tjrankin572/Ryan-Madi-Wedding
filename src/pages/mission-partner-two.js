            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Our goal is to intervene in situations of human trafficking and provide relief for those vulnerable to it. 
              Often this relief will be provided by partners in the areas that we are working with. 
              We will be facilitating trips to visit these areas. Mission trips will support sustainability by creating infrastructure 
              in which we can sell hand-made products and other items. 
              Raise visibility by creating content to promote awareness. </p>
            <p>We will accomplish this goal by reaching out to the lives of women and children that have been impacted by poverty, 
              abuse and trafficking. We will provide basic needs (clothing, food and medicine) then provide education and 
              opportunities for these people to move beyond the crisis state into a sustainable occupation.
