## Purpose
To build a wedding website for my older brother!

## What I learned
For website, I really wanted to replicate the single page app that I created for CaileyAndJustinWedding I made within Hugo, but within Gatsby. And it served its purpose of helping my brother collect RSVPs for his wedding.

The website turned out incredibly well with it being one of my favorite designs.

The domain has since expired so in order to preview the site click on the following link: (<a href="https://kind-euclid-5a4f03.netlify.app/">RyanAndMadiWedding.com</a>)
